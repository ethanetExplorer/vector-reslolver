# A vector resolver
---
> Note: This is not a general purpose vector resolver that anyone can just use. This is very specially designed for the types of questions I wa doing at the time.

I did not want to spend 30 minutes manually calculating and messing with my calculator (Trigonometry, pythagoras' theorem etc.) doing a few questions on resolving non-perpendicular vectors. Hence, I spent 30 minutes writing this code to help me automate that.
